If the phrase is not present in a research paper then it will not be used for research. After annotation, we need to find the best ML/DL model to train research data and evaluate the model on test data.Our SolutionWe have created a python script that can compare all medical research paper text to research phrases and annot 0 if research phrases are not present in a medical research paper and 1 if research phrases present in medical research paper.After annotation we have trained different machine learning and deep learning models like Bert base uncased using Tensorflow, bert large, XGBoost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression. Among these models we have chosen the best accuracy  parameters model. In our case the bert-base model performed good and gave 95% test accuracy.Project DeliverablesML/DL model which is trained on medical research classification data to classify other medical research papers.Tools usedGoogle Colab notebooks, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Transformers, MS ExcelLanguage/techniques usedPython, Machine learning, Deep learning, Data Science, Natural Language Processing (NLP).Models usedTensorflow-Bert model, PyTorch LSTM model, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, Logistic Regression.Skills usedMachine Learning, Deep learning, NLP, Python programming.Databases usedused ms excel dataWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionThere are various technical challenges faced during project execution:The research paper has a huge amount of text data so the model was giving space errors in colab notebooks.Find the best threshold value which gives best test accuracy.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedTo solve space error we have trained the model with lower batch size so this solved the error.To find the best threshold value we created the ROC AUC curve and Precision  Recall curve and checked best points where accuracy will be higher.Previous articleDesign & Develop BERT Question Answering model explanations with visualizationNext articlePlaystore & Appstore to Google Analytics (GA) or Firebase to Google Data Studio Mobile App KPI DashboardAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORAI and ML-Based YouTube Analytics and Content Creation Tool for Optimizing Subscriber Engagement and Content StrategyEnhancing Front-End Features and Functionality for Improved User Experience and Dashboard Accuracy in Partner Hospital ApplicationROAS Dashboard for Campaign-Wise Google Ads Budget Tracking Using Google Ads APMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSChatbot and conversation agent Transform the experience and engagementJune 12, 2019Python model for the analysis of sector-specific stock ETFs for investment...December 31, 2022An outlook of healthcare by the year 2040, and how it...August 20, 2022AI Conversational Bot using RASAFebruary 19, 2022Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSRole of big data & analytics in banking and financeShould celebrities be allowed to join politics?Data Warehouse to Google Data Studio (Looker) DashboardCommunication with Twilio-Flex
