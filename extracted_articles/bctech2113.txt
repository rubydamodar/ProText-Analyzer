We also need to decrease time probability based on the user’s past time range.Our SolutionWe converted the user’s plugin data into binary values like 0 if the user hasn’t plugged-in his vehicle on that day and 1 if he plugged-in. We identified the driven distance based on the amount of charge used between two plug-in times. Then we trained the Ridge Regression ML model for identifying each day driven kilometer. From these kilometres we have identified the probability that user’s will plug-in today and it will increase day by day till the user does not plug-in his vehicle.For time probability we have used Probability Distribution Function (PDF) and Cumulative Distribution Function  (CDF). These functions will decrease probability according to the user’s time range.Project Deliverables2 python scripts to:Train regression model every day.Use model weights to generate probability values.Tools usedGoogle Colab, VS Code, Google Drive, and MS Excel.Language/techniques usedPython programming language, Data Analytics with numpy and pandas, Data Visualization with matplotlib, Statistics and Mathematics, Machine learning with SKlearn.Models usedRidge Regression ModelSkills usedData Analytics, Data Visualization, Machine learning, Python, StatisticsDatabases usedlocal data from MS Excel SheetWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionThere are a lot of challenges faced during project executionAt the start, we have only imaginary data so need to convert in a good format to apply machine learning models.Find the best machine learning model for the data.Decrease the time probability according to user’s time rangeHow the Technical Challenges were SolvedWe have converted the data into weekday’s binary values like marked 0 if not plugged-in vehicle on that day and 1 if plugged and calculated driven distance by amount of charge used between two plugin dates.Tried different regression based machine learning models like Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, Ridge Regression and checked accuracies of all models and choosed best one.For decreasing time probability we used Probability Distribution Function (PDF) and Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). These functions decrease probability according to the user’s time range.Project SnapshotsPrevious articlePower BI Data-Driven Map DashboardNext articleReal-time dashboard to monitor infrastructure activity and MachinesAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORAI and ML-Based YouTube Analytics and Content Creation Tool for Optimizing Subscriber Engagement and Content StrategyEnhancing Front-End Features and Functionality for Improved User Experience and Dashboard Accuracy in Partner Hospital ApplicationROAS Dashboard for Campaign-Wise Google Ads Budget Tracking Using Google Ads APMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSBig Data Analytic in Construction & Real EstateJune 20, 2019Rise of telemedicine and its Impact on Livelihood by 2040January 2, 2023Advanced AI for Pedestrian Crossing SafetyJuly 22, 2023How is Login Logout Time Tracking for Employees in Office done...September 28, 2021Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSHow AI will change the World?Amazon Buy Bot, an Automation AI tool to Auto-CheckoutsImpact of COVID-19 pandemic on Tourism & Aviation industriesBig Data Analytics in Healthcare
