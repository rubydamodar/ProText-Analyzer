The dataset contained Short durations as well as Long durations. Build models for each set of durations, compare and get the best out of all.Our SolutionHere, we had to predict the traffic incident duration with some machine learning tools and techniques i.e. XGBoost, SVR and Deep Learning algorithm using tensor flow. First two models were run on Python Interpreter whereas Deep learning model was run on R studio, all the three with the same dataset and then we had compared these models based on their MAE (mean absolute error). Initially, we had done a preliminary analysis of the collected incident duration data, to collect the statistical characteristics of all the variables used in our research.Project DeliverablesPython Script for each model.Documentation for Research Work.Tools usedPython InterpreterLanguage/techniques usedLanguage Used: PythonLibraries Used: pandas, sklearn, numpy, keras, pickleModels usedXGBRegressorSVRSGDRegressorSequentialDecisionTreeRegressorSkills usedProgramming, Statistical AnalysisProject SnapshotsPrevious articleStatistical Data Analysis of Reinforced ConcreteNext articleHow does Metaverse work in the Financial sector?Ajay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORAI and ML-Based YouTube Analytics and Content Creation Tool for Optimizing Subscriber Engagement and Content StrategyEnhancing Front-End Features and Functionality for Improved User Experience and Dashboard Accuracy in Partner Hospital ApplicationROAS Dashboard for Campaign-Wise Google Ads Budget Tracking Using Google Ads APMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSPowerBI REST API – Fetching Dataflow and Refresh Schedules with semantic...August 25, 2024Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Effect: The Impact and Role of Mass Media...March 30, 2020KPI Dashboard for AccountantsJuly 21, 2023Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on public transportation industries.June 23, 2020Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSEquity Waterfalls Model-Based SaaS Application for Real Estate SectorAI Dashboard of Health Fitness – In-Depth LookSteps to Meta-AnalysisTurn Your Website Analytics into Actionable Insights & Decisions Using Neo4J...
