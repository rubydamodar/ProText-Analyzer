The program will work as follows:A user inputs the URL of the case report they want to extract data from.The program sends a GET request to the webpage and parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.The program then identifies the relevant sections of the webpage (such as the title, introduction, report, conclusion, and keywords) and extracts the text content.For each reference linked in the case report, the program sends a GET request to the reference’s webpage and parses the HTML content.The program then sends a prompt to the GPT-3 model, asking it to summarize the content of the reference, and receives a summarized response.The program collects all the summarized references and adds them to the case report.The program also identifies any images associated with the case report and downloads them.Finally, the program creates a Word document and adds all the collected information (including the summarized references and downloaded images) to the document.Solution ArchitectureDeliverablesA fully functional web scraping tool that can extract data from a given webpage and generate a case report.A detailed documentation explaining how to use the tool and what kind of data it can extract.Tech StackTools usedPythonBeautifulSoupSeleniumOpenAI’s GPT-3Language/techniques usedPythonModels usedOpenAI’s GPT-3Skills usedWeb ScrapingNatural Language ProcessingMachine LearningWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionHandling dynamic websites that load content via JavaScript.Managing rate limits and CAPTCHAs imposed by the target websites.Ensuring the accuracy and relevance of the summarized content generated by the GPT-3 model.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedUsing Selenium to interact with the JavaScript-rendered content of the target websites.Implementing strategies to bypass rate limits and CAPTCHAs.Fine-tuning the parameters of the GPT-3 model to improve the quality of the summarized content.Business ImpactThe implementation of our web scraping and summarization tool has had significant positive impacts on our business operations.Firstly, it has streamlined our research process by automating the extraction of crucial information from various online sources.
