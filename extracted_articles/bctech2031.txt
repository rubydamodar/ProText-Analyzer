The areas of the concerned queries should include Environment Analysis, Workflow Analysis, Data Source and Target Mapping, Transformation Logic, Data Volume and Velocity, Error Handling and Logging and Security and Access Control.Our SolutionIn developing our solution, we began by aggregating Open-Source Generic ETL Tool Code from various repositories on GitHub and other relevant sources. Subsequently, we meticulously fine-tuned the collected ETL tool code, organizing and saving it into distinct folders, each containing different ETL pipelines.Following this, we implemented an OpenAI Assistant, integrating it with all the refined ETL pipelines. To facilitate communication with these pipelines, we employed the OpenAI Assistant ID within our Flask API.For the user interface, we opted for a Streamlit front-end, providing a seamless and user-friendly interaction with our OpenAI Assistant and the integrated ETL pipelines.Solution ArchitectureETL Discovery Tool serves as the core engine for Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations. It is designed to handle data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks efficiently. It will be used for training the OpenAI model on the ETL Discovery tools.Step 1.Open-Source Generic ETL Tool Code:The Open-Source Generic ETL Tool serves as the core engine for Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations. It is designed to handle data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks efficiently. It will be used for training the OpenAI model on the ETL Discovery tools.Step 2.Data Cleaning:Data Cleaning is a critical stage that involves cleansing and pre-processing raw data to enhance its quality and integrity. In this step the ETL understands the expected data format that is organized and cleaned for uniformity of data.Step 3.Files/DBRepresents the storage or databases utilized for storing processed data. In this step, solutions for processed data the code files will be arranged and catalogued so that they are ready to be used by the OpenAI Assistants API.Step 4.OpenAI Assistant Creation via API:This step involves creating an OpenAI Assistant using the OpenAI API.Configuring the OpenAI AssistantConfigure .env file with OpenAI API KeyWe will upload the files to the Assistant for it to be added in context.Run assistant creator.py  file for generating OpenAI Assistant IDAfter Generating OpenAI Assistant id look into terminal save the generated ID into .env fileWe will get the assistant ID that is to be used later.Step 5.OpenAI Assistant:In this step, the Assistant that is created from previous step will be queried by the API with instructions for the context accommodation.Features and Capabilities: functionalities supported by the assistantOpenAI Assistant will read all our ETL pipeline which is provided when we are generating the OpenAI assistant IDUsage Guidelines/Instructions: – Guide users on interacting with the OpenAI AssistantWe are providing Instructions to our OpenAI Assistant to communicate with userStep 6.Django/Flask/FastAPI API:This step involves setting up an API using popular frameworks like Django, Flask, or FastAPI.Framework Selection: choice of the specific frameworkWe are using Flask API to communicate with the OpenAI AssistantAPI Endpoints:  available endpoints and their functionalitiesConfigured the OpenAI Key in app1.pyConfigured the OpenAI Assistant ID in app1.pyStore the Instruction file into variable we are using the variable belowAfter the Configuration of Flask file run the app1.py file to start the Flask API Local ServerAuthentication: – Used for securing the APIHandling Request and Response processStep 7.Chat Frontend (Streamlit):Represents the user interface for interacting with the system, built using Streamlit.Configurations: Configurations of Streamlit frontendSet your OpenAI API key into .env fileUser Interaction: Users will be able to query based on training data.Integration with Backend: – Frontend will be connect to the backend API.In the main.py file Provide the Flask API url endpoint to communicate with OpenAI AssistantHandle Request and Response from the UserDeliverablesOpenAI Assistant Flask APIStreamlit frontendTech StackTools usedVisual Studio CodeLanguage/techniques usedPython, Flask, OpenAIModels usedOpenAI AssistantSkills usedPython, RestAPI, OpenAI APIWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionFinding the ETL pipelines and fine tuning the ETL pipelinesHow the Technical Challenges were solvedOur approach to overcoming technical challenges involved an extensive internet search focused on ETL pipelines. We scoured various online resources, eventually identifying the most effective ETL pipelines available on GitHub.To address each challenge systematically, we created individual files for each ETL pipeline. In the process, we meticulously fine-tuned and optimized each pipeline, documenting the specific tasks and functions within the respective files. This approach allowed us to provide detailed descriptions of the work performed for every ETL pipeline, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the solutions implemented to tackle the technical hurdles encountered.Business ImpactThe business impact was substantial as the client efficiently analysed numerous ETL tool pipelines. Instant answers in a chat format replaced the time-consuming manual work that could take Data Engineers days or weeks. This streamlined process significantly enhanced productivity and responsiveness, reflecting a tangible improvement in operational efficiency for the client.Project SnapshotsAssistant_creator.pyMain.pyProject VideoProject Demo Video link:-https://www.loom.com/share/5ee7d0835412474ea4aa3383af5a0814?sid=999739fc-e91a-4cda-a30e-9cd02957205fInstallation Walkthrough Video:-Part 1 (Backend):-https://www.loom.com/share/338c4e09c90e453e83b86050d469d98b?sid=03299e7a-0699-464e-be2c-689a409ec01ePart 2 (Frontend):-https://www.loom.com/share/8e7942f3a03e49889c6c70fba77f76b0?sid=eca0586f-b767-45fa-854d-853bca1890dcProject GitHub RepositoryGitHub Link:- https://github.com/AjayBidyarthy/Rob-Sandberg-ETLSummarizeSummarized: https://blackcoffer.com/This project was done by the Blackcoffer Team, a Global IT Consulting firm.Contact DetailsThis solution was designed and developed by Blackcoffer TeamHere are my contact details:Firm Name: Blackcoffer Pvt.
