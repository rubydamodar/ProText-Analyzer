We were tasked with developing a machine learning model that could accurately predict circuit performance based on the input parameters, while also incorporating the underlying physics principles that govern circuit behavior.Our SolutionOur team utilized Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Octave, and MATLAB to build the PINN. We used TensorFlow models to build the neural network and Microsoft Excel to clean and preprocess the data. Our team employed Python programming, TensorFlow, Pandas, and MATLAB skills to build the PINN. We did not use any databases for this project, nor did we use any web/cloud servers.Project DeliverablesThe final deliverable was a functional PINN capable of evaluating circuits based on the provided parameters.Tools usedOur team used Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Octave, MATLAB, and Microsoft Excel.Language/techniques usedThe primary languages and techniques we used were Python programming, TensorFlow, and MATLAB.Models usedWe used TensorFlow models to build the neural network for the PINN.Skills usedOur team utilized Python programming, TensorFlow, Pandas, and MATLAB skills to build the PINN.Databases usedWe did not use any databases for this project.Web Cloud Servers usedWe did not use any web/cloud servers for this project.What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionThe project was very challenging since our team did not have a background in electrical engineering. It was difficult to understand the physics behind the circuit evaluation, and we faced issues when using MATLAB to provide data for the project.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedWe worked with the client to gain a better understanding of the physics behind the circuit evaluation. We also worked with MATLAB experts to help us better understand how to provide data for the project.Business ImpactThe PINN we built for Mohamed Zamil allowed for efficient circuit evaluation and improved the overall accuracy of the evaluation process.Project website urlhttps://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HX37MP4Jcb39SWJgkE_5z5n1gQwqWmV9Project VideoContact DetailsHere are my contact details:Email: ajay@blackcoffer.comSkype: asbidyarthyWhatsApp: +91 9717367468Telegram: @asbidyarthyFor project discussions and daily updates, would you like to use Slack, Skype, Telegram, or Whatsapp?
