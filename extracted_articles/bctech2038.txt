To accomplish the given task, 2 tools were developed for each website.Search tool was developed to search the keyword in the website’s search bar and count displayed for keywords of each category was stored in separate files.Content tool was developed which scraped full text from each url obtained from the respective sitemaps. Along with the text visible on the page, data from meta keywords, meta description and title was also scrapped.Extracted content from all the websites was stored in their respective text files. After that number of keywords in the text were counted using substring and count method and stored the keyword and its corresponding count in an Ordered Dictionary and then the count was transferred to a list and Excel file was created for the same.
