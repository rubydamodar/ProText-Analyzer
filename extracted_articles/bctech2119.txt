We have found the co-relation between the tempa msa pitchbook data and the output files like textual file, ai_ml_tm file etc. We have made the dashboard using the Google Data Studio.Project DeliverablesWe have provided a excel file consisting of clean data and the Google Data Studio report.Tools usedPython, Google Data Studio, Google ChromeLanguage/techniques usedPython ProgrammingModels usedWaterfall model used in this project.Skills usedData cleaning, Data Pre-processing, Data Visualisation are used in this project.Databases usedWe have used the traditional file systems as database storage.What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionCleaning the data was the major challenge faced while executing the project. The data has a lot of noise. It was difficult to find which data was useful and which data is not useful in this project. Secondly the co relation between the output files and pitchbook data. There was nothing common between both the datasets. So was difficult to find co-relation between them.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedWe used pandas dataframe to clean the data and make it ready for predictive modelling and used the Google Data studio to find insights between the different datasets.Project SnapshotsProject VideoPrevious articleAWS QuickSight Reporting DashboardNext articleHow Metaverse is Shaping the Future?Ajay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORAI and ML-Based YouTube Analytics and Content Creation Tool for Optimizing Subscriber Engagement and Content StrategyEnhancing Front-End Features and Functionality for Improved User Experience and Dashboard Accuracy in Partner Hospital ApplicationROAS Dashboard for Campaign-Wise Google Ads Budget Tracking Using Google Ads APMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSHow to Overcome Your Fear of Making MistakesAugust 23, 2020Automated Orthopedic Case Report Generation: Harnessing Web Scraping and AI IntegrationMarch 16, 2024Amazon Buy Bot, an Automation AI tool to Auto-CheckoutsJune 26, 2021Networking Platform – Have a lookMarch 14, 2021Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSMisesBot Activate – Markov Chain, Text GeneratorHow Data Analytics and AI are used to halt the COVID-19...Rise of Cybercrime and its Effect by the Year 2040.How robots can help in e-learning platforms?
