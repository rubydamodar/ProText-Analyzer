We need to use machine learning and deep learning models which have greater than 90% accuracy.Our SolutionWe created a notebook for anomaly detection. We used 10 to 15 machine learning and deep learning models but onlyÂ  3 different types of auto encoder models that were giving greater than 90% accuracy. We trained all 3 models on one classification data which have anomalies and evaluated trained models on test data.Project DeliverablesA notebook that has solutions for anomaly detection related classification problems and accuracy should be above 90%.Tools usedGoogle colab notebooks, Tensorflow, Google driveLanguage/techniques usedPython programming language, Machine learning, Deep learning, Data analysis and Data visualization.Models usedAuto Encoder and Variational Auto EncoderSkills usedPython, Data Analysis, Data visualization, Machine learning, Deep learning.Databases usedMS ExcelWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionMost of the anomaly detection models work with regression type data and this problem was classification problem so we need to deal with classification data.Getting high accuracy is also a tough challenge for us because there are only a few models which work well on anomaly detection related classification problems.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedSo we have limited models for this problem so we used only classification models like Autoencoders, Isolation forest and one class svm.Only Autoencoder was giving high accuracy so we worked with different types of autoencoders like variational autoencoder and normal autoencoder.Project SnapshotsPrevious articleAn ETL Solution for Currency Data to Google Big QueryNext articleDesign & Develop BERT Question Answering model explanations with visualizationAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORAI and ML-Based YouTube Analytics and Content Creation Tool for Optimizing Subscriber Engagement and Content StrategyEnhancing Front-End Features and Functionality for Improved User Experience and Dashboard Accuracy in Partner Hospital ApplicationROAS Dashboard for Campaign-Wise Google Ads Budget Tracking Using Google Ads APMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSStreamlined Integration: Interactive Brokers API with Python for Desktop Trading ApplicationMarch 17, 2024COVID-19: How have countries been responding?April 29, 2020Impact of COVID-19 on Engineering and Medical College during this pandemic...December 7, 2021Big Data Analytics in HealthcareJuly 19, 2019Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSRising IT cities and its impact on the economy, environment, infrastructure,...Key Audit Matters Predictive ModelingIoT & AI/ML Solution for Gas StationsData Analytics Solution for the Hospitality Industry
