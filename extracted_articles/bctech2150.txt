Clr. 1], for numbers between 5858 & 8678 choose another bright color [Br. Clr. 2], for numbers between 8679 & 11500 choose B (Blue), for numbers between 11501 & 50,000 choose R (Red), and > 50,000 choose G (Green). Simulate these 4 Task scenarios and represent them in a Table (1000 x 32) and collect statistics at the end. Replicate the simulation exercises for each Task with 3 different initial seed numbers. Likewise for 16 other Tasks.Our SolutionTask involves creating 20 excel files running a Python Script in Jupyter Notebook which contains certain integer ranges indicating certain values and some other criteria the Random number range [1 to 1 million].There are 20 Different tasks which have different conditions based on which need to form. Simulate these 20 Tasks and represent them in a Table (1000 x 32) and collect statistics at the end. Replicating the simulation exercises for each Task with 3 different initial seed numbers.Then using the Find and Replace tab of excel to make it in the correct format with proper color.
