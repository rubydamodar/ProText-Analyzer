Get the following live data from FieldPulse to Google Data Studio(GDS) for making Business Dashboard in GDS –Job DataTag DataTeam Member DataTeam DataSuch that if data changes in FieldPulse , GDS Dashboard should update automatically.Our SolutionFor fetching data from FieldPulse –Data Pipeline (FieldPulse to GCP MySQL):  We have created a Data Pipeline that uses web scraping to fetch data from FieldPulse. It makes a GET request to the FieldPulse API , and the API returns raw data. Convert this into json format then in Dataframe. Now , create new tables in GCP MySQL and insert/update the data accordingly.Insertion & Updation of Data :Insertion :If any data fetched from Fieldpulse is not present in their respective database table , then  insert that data in the table.Updation :If any data fetched from Fieldpulse is present in their respective database table , then update that data in the table.Deploy the above Data Pipeline in GCP VM instance:  Deploy the above data pipeline in GCP VM so that data gets updated every hour from FieldPulse to MySQL.For getting data from GCP MySQL to Google Data Studio(GDS) :Connecting GCP MySQL to Google Data Studio:  Connect GCP MySQL to GDS as follows –Open a new reportClick on add dataChoose MySQL connectorEnter following fields :Host Name or IP  :xxx.xxx.xxx.xxxDatabase             :xyzUsername            :xyzPassword             :**********Enable SSLUploadserver-ca.pemcertificateUploadclient-cert.pemcertificateUploadclient-key.pemcertificateClick AuthenticateAdd whatever table you wantBuild VisualizationProject DeliverablesBelow are the services that we provided to client after completion of this project –Deployed Data Pipeline in GCP:  A Data Pipeline connecting FieldPulse(https://webapp.fieldpulse.com/) to GCP MySQL that is deployed on a client’s GCP VM instance. It updates the data in MySQL every hour. It extracts the following data tables from FieldPulse –Job DataTag DataTeam Member DataTeam DataMaintaining a log file in Google Cloud :There is a log file in cloud to resolve unexpected error quickly if any , log file stores following details –last pipeline synced timeError type if anyError location if anyWork Order Data :Job idWork order no.Tags titlesStart_timeJob_typeCreated ByStatusInvoice_statusAssigned teams nameProject_idAssignment_countAssignable_typeNotesCustomer_notesCustomer_first_nameCustomer_last_nameLocationAssigned_team_members nameEnd_timecreated_atJob Tag Data :Tag idsCompany_idMongo_idTitle (Tag name)TypeColorCreated_atUpdated_atdeleted_atSetup to Connect GCP MySQL to Google Data Studio(GDS):  Provided a setup to connect GCP MySQL to GDS easily. Client can access his live data from MySQL to GDS and make visualizations out of it.Tools usedGoogle ColabLanguage/techniques usedPythonWeb ScrapingMySQLSkills usedProgramming in PythonData Structure & AlgorithmWeb ScrapingFile HandlingGoogle CloudGoogle Data StudioDatabases usedMySQLWeb Cloud Servers usedGoogle Cloud Platform (GCP)What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionGetting Data from FieldPulse :As there is no open source package/library in Python for accessing Fieldpulse API , we struggled a lot to get the desired data from FieldPulse.Setting Up Connection from GCP MySQL to GDS :Due to firewall and VPN , connection was not set up as IP address changes while using VPN. It was showing an error every time someone tries to connect to MySQL from their Google Studio account.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedGetting Data from FieldPulse :We did use web scraping for this. We explored all the API addresses. We connected to each possible address and got the data then explored the data. Made a list of addresses which contains data of our interest. Also data is stored in a scattered and cascaded manner in FieldPulse with ids. So , we had to fetch a lot of extra tables and then join multiple tables to get a desired data table.Setting Up Connection from GCP MySQL to GDS :To resolve this issue , we did as below –set up the IP address in GCP MySQL security to 0.0.0.0 , so that any system can access it. (VPN issue resolved)Enabled the SSL in GCP MySQL.
