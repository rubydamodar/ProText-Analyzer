The tasks include video and image capturing, working with documents such as PDF and Excel files, converting text to audio, audio capturing and transcription, translation to major languages, utilizing language models with a focus on Jina finetuner and its limitations, creative AI for generating pictures and designs, synthesizing language texts, creating Kibana dashboards and data storytelling, code creation for specific platforms like Editorjs and Nextjs, integrating Jina API inference into function blocks in Editorjs/Nextjs, UX/UI creation for the front end of Editorjs and Nextjs, transfer learning and reinforcement learning, utilizing Wikipedia for general knowledge, and utilizing an epistemic model called EPINET. To fulfill this task, you will need to search for relevant models, tools, and resources specific to each task mentioned above.Our SolutionJina AI Hub to deliver an ecosystem of:Core transformer modelDistilled & Fine tuned modelsOKR:s/KPI:s +domain data = “Book of knowledge” + model = AI agentsEnsembled models = AI teamsAlso delivered functions in the marketplaceVoice interface, OpenAI Whisper transformerMultiple data types capturing of information (DocArray)CLIP model to mesh multiple data types into vectorsNeural Search function andGenerative AI functionAutomatic data labellingUsed weight watcher to fine tune the model quality without CPU/GPU costSolution ArchitectureAutomatic selection a model for fine tuning with data corpus (book of knowledge), given the best performance.Add the model to an API inferenceUnlike ChatGPT the model can specify when they don’t know and acknowledge it instead of making stuff up with its creative ability.When the model knows what it doesn’t know, it can ask to go back and consult other models for joint predictions.Add a function to select ensembled models for joint prediction when step 4 occurs.DeliverablesIdentify core transformer models“Clean” and stabilize selected core modelsSet up the process in Jina HubIntegrate FastAPI/Jina with our Jina HubIntegrate FastAPI/Argilla/Kibana into our Jina HubTools usedJina Hub/AI, Python, Hugging Face, Argilla, Redis stack, KibanaLanguage/techniques usedPythonModels usedEpistemic Neural Nets, weight watcher, OpenAI Whisper transformer, EpinetContact DetailsHere are my contact details:Email: ajay@blackcoffer.comSkype: asbidyarthyWhatsApp: +91 9717367468Telegram: @asbidyarthyFor project discussions and daily updates, would you like to use Slack, Skype, Telegram, or Whatsapp?
