The main motive was to understand the behaviour of concrete based on various parameters – Compressive strength, Flexural strength, water absorption capabilities of the concrete and many more. The analysis should include, but was not limited to:Comparison of Mo (control mix) with all mixes at 28 days for each parameter testComparing all parameters for all specimens (all concrete mixes) with 28 days and also 6 months heat-cool and wet-dryall other expected analysis we could see you and doPhase 2:In this phase, we had to develop a structure for the research paper based on the results and analysis. The paper included sections – Abstract, Introduction ( literature, background and objective), Experimental program ( materials and methods), Results and discussion ( analysis and interpretation) and Conclusion ( summary, insights and remarks).Our SolutionProviding a Comprehensive analysis for the concrete data – showcasing the key insights from it based on the parameters (compressive strength, etc). On the basis of results from the analysis, research paper was drafted which included all the deliverable.Project DeliverableA manuscript (drafted article) with the following:AbstractIntroduction ( literature, background and objective)Experimental program ( materials and methods)Results and discussion ( analysis and interpretation)Conclusion ( summary, insights and remarks)ReferencesTools usedTools used:Jupyter – Notbebook (Python)NumpyPandasSklearnMatplotlibSeabornMS ExcelGoogle spreadsheetsLanguage/techniques usedPythonStatistical ModellingStatistical InferenceModels usedStatistical models – linear, polynomial, exponential and logarithmic models build for showcasing behavior of concrete mixes due to mixing of different fiber content and its effect on different parameters specified above.Skills usedCoding – PythonPerforming statistical analysis – extracting inferencesBuilding statistical models – through python or through Excel and its counterparts.Databases usedNo database was used.Web Cloud Servers usedNo Cloud server was used.What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionThe Challenges faced during project execution are:Getting statistical models from seaborn libraries, there is no direct way to get the models from the graphs created from data.Building models in excel and validating it (didn’t know how, had to learn it before applying it).How the Technical Challenges were SolvedI had to use different libraries for building the models, later on turned to MS excel and spreadsheet because they were building models and were also able to showcase it on the data itself. For this, I learned how to build models on the aforementioned software through YouTube and blogs.Project SnapshotsProject VideoPrevious articleDatabase Normalization & Segmentation with Google Data Studio Dashboard InsightsNext articleIncident Duration Prediction – Infrastructure and Real EstateAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORAI and ML-Based YouTube Analytics and Content Creation Tool for Optimizing Subscriber Engagement and Content StrategyEnhancing Front-End Features and Functionality for Improved User Experience and Dashboard Accuracy in Partner Hospital ApplicationROAS Dashboard for Campaign-Wise Google Ads Budget Tracking Using Google Ads APMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSDatabase Normalization & Segmentation with Google Data Studio Dashboard InsightsFebruary 27, 2022Text Summarizing Tool to scrape and summarize pubmed medical papersFebruary 28, 2024How To Secure (SSL) Nginx with Let’s Encrypt on Ubuntu (Cloud...August 8, 2023Global financial crisis 2008 causes/effects and its solutionAugust 23, 2020Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSWhat are the key policies that will mitigate the impacts of...Rise of telemedicine and its Impact on Livelihood by 2040How does marketing influence businesses and consumers?AI in healthcare to Improve Patient Outcomes
