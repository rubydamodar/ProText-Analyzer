Also work for Phase 3 has been started in between to complete the Project as soon as possible in a best way.Project DeliverablesThere is a file containing excel sheet and a word file containing a summary of the dataset and folders of text files containing samples of data from Phase 2.Tools usedPython, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, Microsoft Excel, Google Chrome is used to complete different phases of this projectLanguage/techniques usedPython programming language is used to do Web Scraping, Automation, Data Engineering in this project.Models usedSDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process.We are using Iterative Waterfall SDLC Model as we have to follow our development of software in phases and we also need feedback on every step of the development of our project so as to keep track of the occurring changes with every step.Figure 1 SDLC Iterative Waterfall ModelSkills usedData scraping, cleaning, pre-processing and creating data pipelines are used in this project.Databases usedWe used the traditional way of storing the data i.e file systems.What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionThere were a lot of challenges we faced during the project execution.As on the internet, raw data is available to us. So, to search for the important data specifically related to Canada only, with a lot of keywords was a challenging part for us.Then, if we somehow manage to do the task by automating it upto some extent only, we are required to find the dates of the articles, news, think tanks, documents etc, that was also a challenging part.While working on Phase 2, we need to scrape the data from the URLs, so sometimes, the news articles were removed from the website, which we earlier took in our datasets which cause problems in extracting the data.Then cleaning the webpages was also challenge for us, because this project is for research, so data is important to us. So, it was difficult to take only that data from website which we require and are most important.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedBelow are the points used to solve the above technical challenges-We used sitemaps of websites to find different articles that we require according to the keywords, manual research was done to find out which URL will solve the purpose. Manual checking of results of automation tools, that we created, was done.To find the dates of the articles, we wrote multiple regular expressions, that will find the match for the dates that we need, also manual checking was done after that.To scrape removed webpages, we used WayBack machine or google archives, which stores all the deleted webpages.To clean the data, we filtered out various HTML tags, classes, ids by using regex, manual research.Project SnapshotsPrevious articleLipsync Automation for Celebrities and InfluencersNext articleA Leading Firm in the USA, SEO and Website OptimizationAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORAI and ML-Based YouTube Analytics and Content Creation Tool for Optimizing Subscriber Engagement and Content StrategyEnhancing Front-End Features and Functionality for Improved User Experience and Dashboard Accuracy in Partner Hospital ApplicationROAS Dashboard for Campaign-Wise Google Ads Budget Tracking Using Google Ads APMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSHow Telehealth and Telemedicine helping people to fight against COVID-19April 26, 2022What is the difference between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Statistics, and...March 9, 2021Meta-Analysis in Healthcare ResearchJanuary 3, 2019Obstacles to data-driven HealthcareJuly 19, 2019Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSDeploy Nodejs app on a cloud VM such as GCP, AWS,...End-to-end tool to optimize routing and planning of field engineers using...COVID-19: How have countries been responding?An AI ML-based web application that detects the correctness of text...
