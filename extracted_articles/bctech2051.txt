Wherever the bangdb is able to manage machine learning model deployment with their inbuilt parameter and hyper tuning parameters for each model.Streaming data from the client which relates to the customer details and the numbers of products offered by the client on their platform, such as Insurance, loans (Business Loans and Personal Loans), Mobile recharge, UPI transactions done by their platform, etc.They wanted the recommendation of other services provided by them to each of their customers who are using their platform.Our SolutionThis Project Module develops according to the Clients Requirements which involves item-based collaborative filtering based on customer behaviour, Firstly classify the customers into various segments on the basis of age, location, gender, and product usage. On the basis of RFM (marketing tactics to classify the customer on the basis of their purchase history, amount spend, and frequency of usage of product) classify them and recommend them the other services based on item-based collaborative filtering.We generated the synthetic data (90 Million events) for the testing of the recommendation model and its accuracy for recommending the other products to customers.Project Deliverables–   KPI of the Customers–   Recommendation model–   Graph databased model–   Data Generation code based on python (using copula-based on PyTorch)Tools usedBangDb Tool (ML, AI, NoSQL database supported)Graph DatabasedGoogle Colab (Data file generation)Tableau for data visualizationLanguage/techniques usedLinux cloud machinePythonGraph DatabaseData visualization toolsModels used-K means model for clustering-Recommendation Engine model-Collaborative based filtering modelSkills used– Machine learning– NoSQL Database– Graph database– Data Generation using python– Linux– Data VisualizationDatabases used– BangDB– Graph Database– Microsoft MYSQL serverWeb Cloud Servers usedAWS cloud serviceWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionDecide the Recommendation Engine based on the use caseFinding the RFM score and classifying the customers into clustersGraph Model to define the relations of customers with each service which they are usingSynthetic data generation(90 Million events) and around 1.5 Gb structured data.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedItem-based collaborative filtering solves the issue of recommendation because we are dealing with almost 14- 15 services.Clustering of customers based on their similaritiesMeasure the RFM score, and group and classify them based on their scores.Graph database provides to reduce complexity and increase the processing speed.Data generation is one of the difficult tasks and generating relational data across 29 different streams using copula and UUID python library function which is based on PyTorch.Business ImpactIt is Qualitative and Quantitative impact on economically where customers are a direct impact of these projects in their life.It is suggesting to the customers what services they have to utilize from the provider and this is a direct impact of the product on the customers.Product is providing the action statement of the usage of services by the customers and impacts them economically as well.The scope impact of product service is Nationwide or statewide.To provide these impact-full services, there is a tech team of Blackcoffer behind itProject SnapshotsContact DetailsHere are my contact details:Email: ajay@blackcoffer.comSkype: asbidyarthyWhatsApp: +91 9717367468Telegram: @asbidyarthyFor project discussions and daily updates, would you like to use Slack, Skype, Telegram, or Whatsapp?
