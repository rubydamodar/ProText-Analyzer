The Scrapy library has been used to crawl and scrape. Beautiful soup could have also been used for the scraping purpose, but for the sake of consistency, Scrapy has been used for both purposes.Scrapy is an application framework for crawling web sites and extracting structured data which can be used for a wide range of useful applications, like data mining, information processing or historical archival.Even though Scrapy was originally designed forweb scraping, it can also be used to extract data using APIs (such asAmazon Associates Web Services) or as a general purpose web crawler.Four Spiders have been created for each category to be scraped. Every spider crawls all the states in Germany and scrapes all the apartment listings for important data. Every spider creates a separate JSON file to store all its data. This data is then converted to CSV using another python script called “conversion”.The python tool has been completely automated and only needs the “Controller” script to be run. The script also has the capability of running every two weeks automatically.Project DeliverablesFour CSV files (one for each category):Mieten Wohnungen.csvKaufen Wohnungen.csvKaufen Anlageobjekte.csvKaufen Grundstuck.csvLanguage/techniques usedPythonWeb Crawling & ScrapingSkills usedData ScrapingData CrawlingAdvanced Python programmingProject SnapshotsPrevious articleTraction Dashboards of Marketing Campaigns and PostsNext articleDatawarehouse, and Recommendations Engine for AirBNBAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORAI and ML-Based YouTube Analytics and Content Creation Tool for Optimizing Subscriber Engagement and Content StrategyEnhancing Front-End Features and Functionality for Improved User Experience and Dashboard Accuracy in Partner Hospital ApplicationROAS Dashboard for Campaign-Wise Google Ads Budget Tracking Using Google Ads APMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSHow to access Amazon Seller Central or Vendor Central data in...March 3, 2021Power BI integration with RestAPI, and SAML IntegrationJune 7, 2021Design and develop a product recommendation engine based on the features...February 27, 2024OCR – Extracting Information from Scanned DocumentsApril 18, 2020Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSData Management, ETL, and Data AutomationTransforming and Managing a Large-Scale SQL Pedigree Database to Neo4j Graph...Big Data Platform and Data Lake ToolBig Data solution to an online multivendor marketplace eCommerce business
