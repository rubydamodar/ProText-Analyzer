All trips on Drive lah are comprehensively insured through our insurance partners so car owners don’t have to worry about their insurance.

With Drive lah you can reduce the cost of ownership by renting it out when you don’t need it in a safe way. Renters can rent those cars when they are not used by their owners at good value.In a fast-growing non-ownership economy where taxi, food, beauty is available on-demand, Drive lah is envisioning to take the lead in distance travel and simplifying car accessWebsitehttp://www.drivelah.sgCompany size11-50 employeesFounded2019Project ObjectiveAutomating the process to get updated Metrics every week.Evaluate the following Performance Metrics which will be used on AWS Quick Sight for Performance Evaluations:Total CancellationsCancellations by HostWeekly Guest Success Rate.Monthly Active User’s {MAUs}Monthly Active Listings {MALs}Total Approved & Live ListingsApproved & Live InstantBookingsApproved & Live Dl GoDelivery Booking ListingsWeekly Active Listings {WALs}Successful HDMUnsuccessful HDMBooking Acceptance RateTotal Requested TripsNew Listings Made LivePercentage of Live Listings Made ActiveMap Location Metrics Table with Postal Districts.DL Live Cars & DL L3M Active CarsHost Experience Team Weekly DashboardNew Weekly Listings DashboardTwo Transaction MetricsBuild Code for extracting Daily Agent Activity Report on Daily Basis.Our SolutionFor Performance Metrics, we suggested that we will Code for each Metric & will store them in a Table on AWS RDS which will be directly synced to the AWS Quick Sight for Performance Evaluations.For Automating the process to get updated Tables of Metrics every week, we suggested to use a Virtual Machine on which we can upload all code files & can run a Cron Job for each file to automatically get updated on specified time every week.Tools usedJupyter NotebookPyCharmMySQL WorkbenchAWS QuicksightLanguage usedPythonDatabase UsedAmazon Relational Database Service (RDS)What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution?Tried with AWS Lambda Function to update tables on AWS RDS but Lambda Function was unable to run complete code.How the Technical Challenges Were Solved?Suggested to use a Virtual Machine on which we can upload our Code Files & can run Cron Job for automatically updating tables on regularly basis.Project SnapshotsMetrics from Listings Table:Host Experience Metric:New Live Listings of Last 7 Days:Line Chart of Total Cancellations & Cancellations by Host:Line Chart of Monthly Active Users (MAU’s):Area Chart of Percentage of Live Listings Made Active:Line Chart of Number of DL GO Listings & Number of Instant Booking Listings:Line Chart of Monthly Active Listings (MAL’s):Line Chart of New Listings Made Live:Vertical Bar Chart of Total Approved & Live Listings:Project Video LinkPrevious articleGoogle Data Studio Dashboard for Marketing, ads and Traction dataNext articleImpact of news, media, and press on innovation, startups, and investmentsAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORAI and ML-Based YouTube Analytics and Content Creation Tool for Optimizing Subscriber Engagement and Content StrategyEnhancing Front-End Features and Functionality for Improved User Experience and Dashboard Accuracy in Partner Hospital ApplicationROAS Dashboard for Campaign-Wise Google Ads Budget Tracking Using Google Ads APMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSImpact of COVID-19 pandemic on office space and co-working industries.June 18, 2020AI and ML technologies to Evaluate Learning AssessmentsSeptember 4, 2021AI Bot Audio to audioApril 3, 2024Coronavirus: Impact on the Hospitality IndustryMay 1, 2020Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSWhy scams like Nirav Modi Happen with Indian banks?Lessons from the past: Some key learnings relevant to the coronavirus...Using Graph Technology to Create Single Customer View.Negative effects of marketing on society
