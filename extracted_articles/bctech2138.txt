Save both the vocals and instrumental files separately as output.Our SolutionI have used Python programming language for this project. The use of a Python library called Spleeter developed by Deezer has been made to achieve our goal.Spleeteris Deezer source separation library with pretrained models written in Python and uses Tensorflow. It makes it easy to train source separation model (assuming you have a dataset of isolated sources), and provides already trained state of the art model for performing various flavor of separation :Vocals (singing voice) / accompaniment separation (2 stems)Vocals / drums / bass / other separation (4 stems)Vocals / drums / bass / piano / other separation (5 stems)2 stems and 4 stems models have high performance on themusdbdataset.Spleeteris also very fast as it can perform separation of audio files to 4 stems 100x faster than real-time when run on a GPU.Project DeliverablesPython tool that takes Hindi song as input and gives two audio files as output: vocals file and instrumental file.Language/techniques usedPythonModels used2 Stems modelSkills usedAdvanced Python programmingProject SnapshotsPrevious articleAI and ML technologies to Evaluate Learning AssessmentsNext articleKey Audit Matters Predictive ModelingAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORAI and ML-Based YouTube Analytics and Content Creation Tool for Optimizing Subscriber Engagement and Content StrategyEnhancing Front-End Features and Functionality for Improved User Experience and Dashboard Accuracy in Partner Hospital ApplicationROAS Dashboard for Campaign-Wise Google Ads Budget Tracking Using Google Ads APMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSGoogle Local Service Ads Missed Calls and Messages Automation ToolAugust 30, 2021QuickBooks dashboard to find patterns in finance, sales, and forecastsSeptember 18, 2021Supplier Insights and Decision Supports for the eCommerce OutletsMarch 23, 2021Ikiga Data, a Global Careers Data and Insights PlatformMarch 14, 2021Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSAd Networks Marketing Campaign Data Dashboard in Looker (Google Data Studio)Evolution of Advertising IndustryThe future of Telehealth services.Deploy and view React app(Nextjs) on cloud VM such as GCP,...
