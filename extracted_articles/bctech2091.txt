To see the function of multiple such power plants that worked simultaneously. These power plants created and supplied energy based on a demand parameter that can be controlled by the observerProject DescriptionThe client defined specific requirements as to how he wanted the model to be.The requirements were divided into 4 parts. Each successive part increased in complexity and required the model to be adjusted or configured to fit that part into itThe entire model when completed contained all the four parts defined by the client in the Statement of work.Our SolutionCreated the model according to requirements.The clustering of multiple agents and their position is decided mathematically based on the total number of agents and the sum of their energies. The agents form a cluster based on the condition that the sum of their power is a figure that is above a certain threshold amount, the threshold amount is also decided by the observer.Project Deliverableshttps://github.com/AjayBidyarthy/Shingi-Samudzi-Build-Netlogo-ABM-for-simulating-Virtual-Power-Grid-economicsAbove is the github link to every state of the model that was delivered to the client.The uploads start from a basic model with only clustering of the agentsThe final upload is a model that contains the full representation of a VPP for simulation.Tools used-Netlogo– pythonLanguage/techniques usedNetlogo uses a specific language that resembles the logo language but has it’s unique syntax and variations in the way variables are stored and how a list is parsedModels usedClusteringSkills usedNetlogo programmingWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionThe major challenge was controlling the behavior of each agent in the model. The lack of understanding of the language and the available resources about it made it challenging to figure out the actual behavior of the agents and the overall model.The decision to decide where exactly each agent will cluster on the grid was difficult primarily because each agent spawned on a random patch of the screen. This meant that each agent would have to be given a spot to land on and form a cluster with other agents.The next challenge was deciding the condition on which the agents will cluster as their relative distance to each other couldn’t be used as a parameter as it wasn’t relevant to the model’s purpose.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedThe technical challenges were solved by extensive research and referring to several forums over the span of 2 months.Project SnapshotsProject Videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzCUzZ0q0Q&ab_channel=BlackcofferPrevious articleTransform API into SDK library and widgetNext articleETL and MLOps Infrastructure for Blockchain AnalyticsAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORAI and ML-Based YouTube Analytics and Content Creation Tool for Optimizing Subscriber Engagement and Content StrategyEnhancing Front-End Features and Functionality for Improved User Experience and Dashboard Accuracy in Partner Hospital ApplicationROAS Dashboard for Campaign-Wise Google Ads Budget Tracking Using Google Ads APMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSEnhancing Data Collection for Research Institutions: Addressing Survey Fatigue and Incorporating...August 25, 2024How prepared is India to tackle a possible COVID-19 outbreak?April 16, 2020Sentiment Analysis of a Leading Restaurants Chain in the USAOctober 5, 2020Networking Platform – Have a lookMarch 14, 2021Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSSupplier Insights and Decision Supports for the eCommerce OutletsWhat is the future of mobile apps?HR Analytics DashboardLessons from the past: Some key learnings relevant to the coronavirus...
