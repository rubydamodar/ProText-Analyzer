However, ODBC connectors were not working for his level of subscription, so he needed a cheaper workaround.Project DescriptionBrodie Johnco had a MongoDB Database containing a large amount of data that he wanted to visualize in a Power BI Dashboard. He initially tried to use ODBC connectors to connect his database to Power BI, but ran into issues due to his level of subscription. We were brought in to help find a cheaper workaround.Our solution involved using Python to extract the relevant data from Brodie’s MongoDB Database. We used the Pandas library to create Dataframes, which we then uploaded to Azure Blob Storage as tables. We set up an Azure pipeline that ran a Python script every 30 minutes to update the tables with new data from the database.Our SolutionWe used Brodie’s MongoDB Database keys to extract relevant Data Clusters as Pandas Dataframes. We then added them as tables to Azure Blob Storage and set up a Python script to an Azure pipeline that refreshed every 30 minutes. This allowed us to keep the data in sync and provide Brodie with up-to-date information for his Power BI Dashboard.Project DeliverablesThe final deliverable was a readable CSV file that contained the converted data from the original JSON format.Tools usedJupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Power BI, MongoDB Compass, Microsoft Excel, Azure Blob StorageLanguage/techniques usedPython, Pandas, Azure Cloud StorageSkills usedPython programming, Azure Cloud Storage, data extraction and manipulationDatabases usedMongoDB DatabaseWeb Cloud Servers usedAzure Blob StorageWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionThe main challenge we faced was finding a way to connect Brodie’s MongoDB Database to his Power BI Dashboard without using ODBC connectors. We overcame this challenge by using Python and Azure Blob Storage to extract and store the relevant data.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedWe solved the issue by using the client’s MongoDB Database keys to extract relevant Data Clusters as Pandas Dataframes. We then added these dataframes as tables to Azure Blob Storage and set the Python script to an Azure pipeline that refreshed every 30 minutes. This allowed the client to access the data in Power BI without the need for ODBC connectors.Business ImpactOur solution allowed Brodie to visualize his data in a Power BI Dashboard without having to pay for expensive ODBC connectors. The Azure Blob Storage solution we implemented was much more cost-effective and provided him with up-to-date information every 30 minutes.Project website urlhttps://github.com/AjayBidyarthy/Brodie-JohncoPrevious articleData TransformationNext articleBuilding a Physics-Informed Neural Network for Circuit EvaluationAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORAI and ML-Based YouTube Analytics and Content Creation Tool for Optimizing Subscriber Engagement and Content StrategyEnhancing Front-End Features and Functionality for Improved User Experience and Dashboard Accuracy in Partner Hospital ApplicationROAS Dashboard for Campaign-Wise Google Ads Budget Tracking Using Google Ads APMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSMarketing Mix Data AnalysisApril 17, 2021What is the repercussion of the environment due to the COVID-19...June 18, 2020Data Management for a Political SaaS ApplicationJuly 27, 2023IoT & AI/ML Solution for Retail Walmart, Big Bazaar, Max, Reliance...January 22, 2020Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSData Integration for MarketersPortfolio: Website, Dashboard, SaaS Applications, Web AppsStatistical SimulationOCR – Extracting Information from Scanned Documents
