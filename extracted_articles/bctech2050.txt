The processed data from this tool will be send to the Google big query database and our GBQ will be linked to the Google Data Studio for the insights presentation. Therefore as the data will keep on updating in the google big query accordingly the dashboard in our google data studio will gets updated.Solution ArchitectureDeliverablesThe final deliverable was the ready-to-use dashboard and website where the preprocessing of the data happens.Tools usedGoogle Cloud platform – Google Big Query (Database)Google Data studio(Visualisation/Dashboard)Heroku Cloud(Hosting the web application)Language/techniques usedPythonSkills usedPython programmingData analytics/VisualisationGoogle Big QueryDatabases usedGoogle Big QueryWeb Cloud Servers usedHeroku CloudWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionThe project was easy to implement and the architecture was simple therefore no major challenges were encountered.Project SnapshotsProject website urlhttps://plaid-conversion.herokuapp.com/Contact DetailsHere are my contact details:Email: ajay@blackcoffer.comSkype: asbidyarthyWhatsApp: +91 9717367468Telegram: @asbidyarthyFor project discussions and daily updates, would you like to use Slack, Skype, Telegram, or Whatsapp?
