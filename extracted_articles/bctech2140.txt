It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process.We are using Iterative Waterfall SDLC Model as we have to follow our development of software in phases and we also need feedback on every step of the development of our project so as to keep track of the occurring changes with every step.Figure 1 SDLC Iterative Waterfall ModelSkills usedSkills such as Data Pre-processing, cleaning, and data manipulation are used in this project.Databases usedWe used traditional way of storing the data i.e file systems.Web Cloud Servers usedCyberduck, which is a libre server and cloud storage browser for Mac and Windows with support for FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, Amazon S3 etc, was used in this project with Amazon S3 servers.What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution?Data to be processed was very big in size, so space complexity was a challenge in this projectHow the Technical Challenges were SolvedTo solve the space complexity issues, we tried PowerBi, but now time complexity arises.Then we did processing in chunks, by reducing file sizes to avoid memory errors.Project Snapshots (Minimum 10 Pictures)Previous articleReal Estate Data WarehouseNext articleAI and ML technologies to Evaluate Learning AssessmentsAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORAI and ML-Based YouTube Analytics and Content Creation Tool for Optimizing Subscriber Engagement and Content StrategyEnhancing Front-End Features and Functionality for Improved User Experience and Dashboard Accuracy in Partner Hospital ApplicationROAS Dashboard for Campaign-Wise Google Ads Budget Tracking Using Google Ads APMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSWhat if the Creation is Taking Over the Creator?June 25, 2021Rise of telemedicine and its Impact on Livelihood by 2040January 2, 2023MetaBridges API Decentraland Integration – AR, VRJanuary 24, 2022How Artificial Intelligence can deliver real value to companies?September 19, 2018Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSHow to Setup Custom Domain for Google App Engine Application?AI Dashboard of Health Fitness – In-Depth LookGrafana Dashboard – Oscar AwardsBig Data Analytics in Healthcare
