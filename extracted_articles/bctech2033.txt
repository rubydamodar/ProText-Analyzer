The image is tagged with the repository URI.Updated Lambda Function: Refers to the Docker image in the ECR repository. The Lambda function configuration is updated to use this reference.DeliverablesSome of the key deliverables:Dockerfile:A Dockerfile in the root of your Lambda function project, specifying the instructions to build the Docker image. This file includes the base image, installation of dependencies, copying of Lambda function code, and setting the handler function.Docker Image:The Docker image built from the Dockerfile. This image encapsulates your Lambda function code and its dependencies.Pushed Image to ECR:The Docker image pushed to your Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository. This involves tagging the image with the ECR repository URI and pushing it to the repository.Updated Lambda Function Configuration:The Lambda function configuration was updated to use the Docker image from ECR. This may involve specifying the ECR URI in the Lambda configuration.Documentation:Documentation outlining the steps to Dockerize the Lambda function and push it to ECR. This documentation should include prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, and any additional considerations.Tech StackTools usedDockerAmazon ECRAmazon Lambda.AWS Management Console.Language/techniques usedNodeJSDocker commandsSkills usedAWS services (Lambda, ECR, etc.).DockerWeb Cloud Servers usedAmazon Web ServicesWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionDependency Management:Challenge: AWS Lambda imposes constraints on runtime dependencies, making it challenging to manage and control library versions.Execution Environment Isolation:Challenge: AWS Lambdaâ€™s managed environment may lack certain runtime configurations and isolation.Monitoring and Logging Integration:Challenge: Efficiently capturing and analyzing performance metrics and logs from Dockerized Lambda functions.How the Technical Challenges were solvedDependency Management:Solution: Use a containerization approach to package dependencies along with the Lambda function, providing better control and isolation. Implement a robust dependency management system within the Docker container.Execution Environment Isolation:Solution: Docker containers offer enhanced isolation. Utilize containers to encapsulate the Lambda function and its dependencies, ensuring consistent execution environments.Monitoring and Logging Integration:Solution: Integrate AWS CloudWatch for basic monitoring.Project SnapshotsCreate ECR Repository:Create directory and initialize npm:View Docker commands:Login to ECR and Build Docker image:Create Lambda Function:Testing Lambda Function:Project VideoDockerizing a Lambda Function:https://www.loom.com/share/e90438538dbb43fd884a51dab6c175e9?t=586&sid=b2e4112e-16b9-4d78-a955-77a289453e59SummarizeSummarized: https://blackcoffer.com/This project was done by the Blackcoffer Team, a Global IT Consulting firm.Contact DetailsThis solution was designed and developed by Blackcoffer TeamHere are my contact details:Firm Name: Blackcoffer Pvt.
