Also notifying clients email passing messages containing daily account data a message format BaseCamp Message Board Campfire respective company projects API python programming, deploying script Heroku Server automating task. Creating BI Dashboard Data Studio connecting BigQuery Creating Live Dashboard, Historical Dashboard companies.On historical data companies, Linear Regression Modelling needs perform create Modelling Dashboard companies Data Studio. needs Exploratory Data Analysis companies Historical Data.To Store Customer Account Report message lead phone lead a daily basis, Script needs created deployed Heroku also need store Historical data companies Finally Create Data Studio Dashboard it.Creating Sales Representation Dashboard two Companies involves multiple Reports blending multiple data sources Big Query.Our Solution>> Module 1: API Data AbstractionWhich first includes generation access token refresh token scope Google AdWord API authentication connecting Google LSA API. fetching daily data JSON format particular account name based customer_id assigned API URL fetching data. Likewise generating a script would Handle data generation active accounts based customer id.>> Module 2: Data Imputation StoringConverting JSON data pandas data frame forming a list data frame active accounts looping deriving certain attributes based handling missing inf values. Finally storing data Google Big Query database within respective table accounts using Bigquery API.>> Module 3: Data Storing BigQuery Notification AutomationThe task automate notifications sent email Basecamp data transferred database a daily basis deploying script Heroku Server setting time parameters based New York time zone.>> Module 4: Automation tools created till now:i. LSA_AccountReport_daily_BigQuery tool: Automation Account Report companies a daily basis. Scheduling 1:00 Los Angeles Timezone.ii. LSA_AccountReport_Historical_API tool: Storing Historical Data companies last Years till end date set.iii. Basecamp_lsa_automation: used pass lsa data a message format Campfire respective companies groups store lsa data combined companies Messageboard Campfire one Automation Python Group Basecamp.iv. LSA_DateRange Tool: Used store missed data companies a sets days months per need.v. LSA_MainSheet_AutoUpdation tool: Auto updation main sheet ‘LSA Client Lead’ Google Sheet. Daily Data fetched basis list required auto update sheet new companies entered would store information like company name, account id database name.vi. LSA_daily_CustomerReport tool: Created Store LSA Customer Report companies database ‘CustomerReport_PhoneLead’ & ‘CustomerReport_MessageLead’ daily basis.vii. Historical_LSA_CustomerReport tool: Created Store LSA Customer Report companies database ‘CustomerReport_PhoneLead’ & ‘CustomerReport_MessageLead’ storing historical data year 2021.>> Module 5: Data Studio BI Dashboards Created:i.
