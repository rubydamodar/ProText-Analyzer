Poor audio quality heavy accents make difficult speech recognition algorithms correctly transcribe audio.How Technical Challenges SolvedTo overcome challenge, decided use a robust speech recognition library supports multiple languages dialects. Additionally, implemented a mechanism allow users manually edit transcribed text, providing control accuracy transcription.Business ImpactThe implementation backend model will significant business impacts:Enhanced Student Engagement: providing immediate feedback student responses, system foster a engaging learning environment. Students receive instant insights communication style areas improvement, encouraging enhance responses overall academic performance.Improved Learning Outcomes: detailed analytics provided system aid educators understanding student learning patterns identifying areas students struggle. inform instructional strategies curriculum adjustments, leading improved learning outcomes.Cost Savings: Automating conversion audio text generation analytics significantly reduce manual labor costs associated grading feedback provision.Scalability: use scalable technologies like Python Flask allows system handle increasing volumes student responses without compromising performance.Data Insights: system generates valuable data insights, including sentiment scores, readability metrics, named entity recognition counts. insights inform strategic decisions policy changes.Customer Satisfaction: providing a seamless, efficient experience students educators, system enhance customer satisfaction, potentially leading increased usage positive word-of-mouth referrals.These impacts align objectives business, making project a high priority. business impact analysis will ensure project aligned organization’s strategic goals potential disruptions identified managed effectivelyProject SnapshotsProject website urlDomain SSL setup completed :https://www.pharmacyinterns.com.au/Web App running successfully URL –http://34.30.224.139/SummarizeSummarized: https://blackcoffer.com/This project done Blackcoffer Team, a Global Consulting firm.Contact DetailsThis solution designed developed Blackcoffer TeamHere contact details:Firm Name: Blackcoffer Pvt.
