Kaggle used download Yolov4 dataset cars satellite images. preprocessed dataset trained model it. model trained, tested sample satellite images worked perfectly fine. Finally, created a script detected cars image highlighted using a bounding box.Project DeliverablesThe final deliverable a ipython Notebook presented Google Colab.Tools usedGoogle Colab, Kaggle, Slack(For Communication)Language/techniques usedPythonModels usedDarknet(CV Model)Skills usedPython programming, AI/ML.What technical Challenges Faced Project ExecutionThe main challenge faced related pre-processing Yolov4 dataset cars satellite images. dataset large cleaned formatted could used training model.How Technical Challenges SolvedWe used Python programming skills developed a script automated pre-processing dataset. saved us a lot time allowed us focus training model.Business ImpactThe project a success client happy final product. car detection model worked perfectly fine sample satellite images could used development application could detect cars real-time.Project website urlhttps://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AoeHdZdpi0lWLf3X2G800J0VT_7wJtnEProject VideoContact DetailsHere contact details:Email: ajay@blackcoffer.comSkype: asbidyarthyWhatsApp: +91 9717367468Telegram: @asbidyarthyFor project discussions daily updates, would like use Slack, Skype, Telegram, Whatsapp?
