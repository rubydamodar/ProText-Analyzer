Based price values calculated EMA, MACD RSI cross using logistic regression. predict cross 1 hour earlier based 2 models.To show cross indicators movement created a python flask web app hosted AWS EC2 server. process runs every 15 minutes checks cross. cross 1 hour sends a telegram notification.DeliverablesFlask web appAll python code machine learning modelsTools usedPandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, flask etc.Language/techniques usedData Analysis, Data Visualization, Machine learning, Deep learning, flask web app etc.Models usedLogistic Regression, LSTM modelSkills usedData Analysis, Data Visualization, Machine learning, Deep learning, flask, python etc.Databases usedMongoDBWeb Cloud Servers usedAWS Ec2What technical Challenges Faced Project ExecutionMain challenge project find best model. time series data cannot change orders get better accuracy.One machine learning model predicting next 15 min cross need ema cross 1 hour before.How Technical Challenges SolvedWe using time series data cannot change order find better accuracy every model. tried different models order evaluated model. logistic regression model worked best data gave 91% accuracy test data.To get next 1 hour prediction first tried logistic regression predict next 3 steps failed poor accuracy. trained LSTM model price data predicted next 3 steps using LSTM model. used logistic regression predict ema cross.Business ImpactIt will help traders predict stock market earlier get better returns project.Project SnapshotsContact DetailsHere contact details:Email: ajay@blackcoffer.comSkype: asbidyarthyWhatsApp: +91 9717367468Telegram: @asbidyarthyFor project discussions daily updates, would like use Slack, Skype, Telegram, Whatsapp?
