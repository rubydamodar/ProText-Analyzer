Title: Data Management a Political SaaS Application - Blackcoffer Insights HomeOur Success StoriesData Management a Political SaaS ApplicationOur Success StoriesGovernment & Think TanksITResearch & AcademiaData Management a Political SaaS ApplicationByAjay Bidyarthy-July 27, 20232760Client BackgroundClient:A leading tech firm USAIndustry Type:ITServices:SaaS, ProductsOrganization Size:100+The ProblemAs per guidelines discussion. Political Research Automated Data Acquisition (PRADA) following phases included.1. Get pics existing EOs (Elected Officials)2. Get new EOs Pictures.3. Run QA checks regularly EOs4. Get data government Facebook pages.5. Geospatial project: Create a new version provided KML without using google earth. Creating a nested directories contained description Map-URL designated location.6. Get data US States Counties(Including Boroughs Parishes)By building automated generated structured data allows a non – programmer create a config page allowing a bot scrap update data.Our SolutionWe created automated python scripts designated phases respective requirements. Solutions various type problems varied data scrapping automation done python developed scripts including geospatial KML task. addition different ranges data scrapped generated directed output respective tasks form CSV format. user’s main aim requirement achieved i.e. a non programmer could create a con-fig initiate a bot scrap required data.Solution ArchitectureThe majority task project consisted web data scraping automation a high- level overview, specific implementation details project shall will follows:Web Scraping Framework: Python a coding language used almost tasks framework used data scraping included Beautiful-Soup, Selenium Web drivers. libraries provide tools functionalities navigate web pages, extract data, handle various HTML elements.Data Extraction Parsing:Use selected web scraping library extract desired data web pages provided either data sheet within websites URLs given sheet. involves locating HTML elements, applying filters selectors, parsing extracted data.Data Processing:Followed data extraction cleansed, transformed aggregated a structured form pandas’ Data Frame followed a CSV file. case geospatial task resulted generation nested folders a kml file.Data Storage:The store scrapped data determined local file system form CSV (Comma Separated Values). appropriate data storage solution according need project. addition geospatial task output form kml file polygons inside directories nested folders.DeliverablesTasksOutputs (CSV/KML/XLSX)Python ScriptsCanada EOsmydata.csvScript1.pyScript2.pyGeospatial TaskElectoral Districts.kml–Facebook Scrapping EOsEO_OUTPUT_O.csvfinal_eo_scrapping.pyFacebook Scrapping 429 CitiesOutput_DRAFT_429_CITIES.csvFacebook_image_scrapping.pyUSA States Website URLsScreenScrapingt.csvfinal_50_states_scrapping.pyUSA Counties Website URLsUS Website_final_write.xlsxcounty_scrapping.pyTools usedPython (Programming Language)Beautiful SoupSeleniumPandasNumpySimplekmlre(regular expressions)Language/techniques usedPython (Programming Language) –It interpreted language, allows quick prototyping interactive coding. versatility one reasons major applications. Different libraries tools used project various data solutions.Beautiful Soup –A python library used web scraping parsing HTML XML documents. provides a convenient way extract said files. eases work flow parsing data extraction encoding handling well.Selenium –A python library used web browser automation like Chrome, Firefox, Safari others. interacts elements clicking buttons, filling forms selecting drop options. project used Chrome. Selenium web driver used web automation. acted bridge Python code Web browser.Pandas –It Python’s versatile library provides high performance data structure tools built top Numpy. Data Frame one key feature due library used. key feature allows efficient manipulation, slicing, filtering structured dataNumpy –It also a python library aka Numerical Python a fundamental library scientific computing Python.Simplekml –It a python package enables generate KML little effort possible.re (Regular Expressions): a powerful tool python sued pattern matching manipulations strings.Skills usedPython ProgrammingWeb FundamentalsWeb Scrapping using libraries BS, Selenium.Data Cleaning ProcessingProblem- Solving debugging.KML structure handling using Python’s programming.Databases usedNone. structured data form either python Data Frames, CSV Excel Sheets.What technical Challenges Faced Project ExecutionFirstly web URLs accessible restricted particular range IPs regionCouldn’t fetch whole data Beautiful Soup couldn’t parse whole tags.List US Counties wasn’t provided given resource linksHow Technical Challenges SolvedUsed VPN accessing Official sites generally accessible.Used Selenium Web driver automate direction URLs fetched complete html tags desired webpages.Performed a search created structure data list counties state used input gain web URLs counties US.Business ImpactEnhanced Analysis: Web scraping allows businesses gather valuable data various websites. information provide insights desired aim objectives enabling businesses make informed.Real-Time Monitoring Upgradation:Web scraping enable business monitor changes updates website real-time. useful tracking regulatory changes. keeps business it’s data updated.Increased Efficiency:Automation eliminated need manual data collection, saving time resources. automated web scraping, business extract large amount data quickly, accurately, improving overall operational efficiency.Project SnapshotsChrome driver initiatedChrome driver visiting directed links accessing image URLsDirected next linkKML taskFacebook Data extractionData State Governments USAccessing links wiki directing countiesNesting within list counties a particular stateFinding Extracting link website CountyProject website urlThe GitHub repository link:- https://github.com/AjayBidyarthy/Paul-Andr-Savoie/tree/mainProject VideoContact DetailsHere contact details:Email: ajay@blackcoffer.comSkype: asbidyarthyWhatsApp: +91 9717367468Telegram: @asbidyarthyFor project discussions daily updates, would like use Slack, Skype, Telegram, Whatsapp?
