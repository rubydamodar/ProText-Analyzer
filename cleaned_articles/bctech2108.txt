Build models set durations, compare get best all.Our SolutionHere, predict traffic incident duration machine learning tools techniques i.e. XGBoost, SVR Deep Learning algorithm using tensor flow. First two models run Python Interpreter whereas Deep learning model run R studio, three dataset compared models based MAE (mean absolute error). Initially, done a preliminary analysis collected incident duration data, collect statistical characteristics variables used research.Project DeliverablesPython Script model.Documentation Research Work.Tools usedPython InterpreterLanguage/techniques usedLanguage Used: PythonLibraries Used: pandas, sklearn, numpy, keras, pickleModels usedXGBRegressorSVRSGDRegressorSequentialDecisionTreeRegressorSkills usedProgramming, Statistical AnalysisProject SnapshotsPrevious articleStatistical Data Analysis Reinforced ConcreteNext articleHow Metaverse work Financial sector?Ajay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE AUTHORAI ML-Based YouTube Analytics Content Creation Tool Optimizing Subscriber Engagement Content StrategyEnhancing Front-End Features Functionality Improved User Experience Dashboard Accuracy Partner Hospital ApplicationROAS Dashboard Campaign-Wise Google Ads Budget Tracking Using Google Ads APMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSPowerBI REST API – Fetching Dataflow Refresh Schedules semantic...August 25, 2024Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Effect: Impact Role Mass Media...March 30, 2020KPI Dashboard AccountantsJuly 21, 2023Impact COVID-19 pandemic public transportation industries.June 23, 2020Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSEquity Waterfalls Model-Based SaaS Application Real Estate SectorAI Dashboard Health Fitness – In-Depth LookSteps Meta-AnalysisTurn Website Analytics Actionable Insights & Decisions Using Neo4J...
